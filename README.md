A latex-to-utf8 autohotkey script.
The default trigger is the (in any case useless) capslock key.
For example, pressing
```
<capslock>+\lambda
```
meaning to first press capslock then type out "\-l-a-m-b-d-a", which
will result in the utf-8 character "Î»" being printed out. Many common
math symbols are already added, and new ones are quickly added, too.
Very handy if you want latex-style shortcuts in other applications.
